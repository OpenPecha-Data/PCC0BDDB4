Sādhana of Sitātapatrā
by Mipham Rinpoche

If you wish to practice Sitātapatrā, then:
rangshyin ösal tongpa chenpo lé
From natural luminosity, the state of great emptiness,
kechik dren dzok chirdok chenmö ku
Instantaneously perfected through mere recollection, appears the Great Dispeller,
karsal chak nyi chok jin dukkar nam
White and radiant, with two hands—one in the gesture of supreme generosity and the other holding
a white umbrella.
dar dang rinchen gyenché yongsu dzok
Garbed in all the silken and jewelled adornments,
dorjé kyiltrung namnang ugyen chen
She sits in the crossed-legged vajra posture with Vairocana as her crown ornament,
mepung long shyuk ponyé trin tro shying
And in an expanse of flames, sends out clouds of emissaries.
gyalwé wangkur sempé tsok kyi kur
She is empowered by the buddhas, honoured by hosts of bodhisattvas,
jikten kyongwa nam kyi ngön chöpé
And worshipped by all the guardians of the world.
tukkar da teng om yik ngak treng gi
At her heart, upon a moon-disc is a syllable Oṃ surrounded by the mantra garland,
ö kyi dön nyi jé shing khyepardu
Which sends out light that accomplishes the twofold benefit, and, in particular,
nedön jetem jik dang nyertsé kün
Carries out the activities of protecting, averting and pacifying
sung dok shyiwé trinlé dzepar gyur
All illness, malevolent spirits, curses, fears, harm and dangers.
om sarwa tatagata ushnisha sitatapatré hung pé | om mama hung ni soha
oṃ sarvatathāgata uṣṇīṣasitātapatrā hūṃ phaṭ | oṃ ma ma hūṃ ni svāhā
Reciting this vidyā-mantra pacifies all adverse factors.
Unconquerable by others, she is famed as the Great Dispeller.
Dhīḥ composed this text in Lhundrub Teng in the Horse year. May it bring virtue.
