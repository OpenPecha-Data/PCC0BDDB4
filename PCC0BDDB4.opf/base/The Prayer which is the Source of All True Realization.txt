The Prayer which is the Source of All True Realization
by Mipham Rinpoche

trulpé guru tsen gyé dang
To the eight manifestations of Guru Rinpoche,
drubpé rigdzin chenpo gyé
The eight great accomplished vidyādharas,
changsem nyewé sé gyé dang
The eight great bodhisattvas,
drubchen kagyé lhatsok la
The eight maṇḍalas of Kagyé with all their deities,
solwa deb so jingyi lob
To you we pray—inspire us with your blessings!
chi nang sangwé barché sol
Dispel all obstacles outer, inner and secret!
sampa yishyin drubpa dang
Fulfil all our aspirations!
chok dang tünmong ngödrub tsol
Grant us attainments ordinary and supreme!

This arose from the lake of the mind of Jampal Dorjé at dawn on the first day of the waning
moon of the month of Pleiades in the Fire Bird year (1897).
