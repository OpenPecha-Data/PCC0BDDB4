A Sādhana of Mārīcī
by Mipham Rinpoche

tongpé ngang lé pema dawé teng
Out of the state of emptiness, upon a lotus and moon,
mam lé nya ngen mepé özer chen
From a syllable Māṃ appears Aśokakāntā-Mārīcī, Sorrowless Resplendence:
ser dok chak yé chok jin chakgya dang
Golden in colour, her right hand in the gesture of supreme generosity,
yönpé nya ngen mepé jönshing nam
And her left hand holding an aśoka plant.
dar dang rinchen gyenché yongsu dzok
She is garbed in all the silken and jewelled adornments,
shyab nyi chekyil pé dé den la shyuk
And her two legs are loosely crossed as she sits on lotus and moon.
tukkar da teng mam la ngak kyi kor
At her heart upon a moon-disc is a syllable Māṃ surrounded by the mantra,
ö trö shyi dang sung sok lé kün drub
From which light radiates out, accomplishing all forms of activity including pacifying and protecting.
om ma ri tsyai soha
Oṃ mārīcyai svāhā
shyen gyi mi tub shyi dang sungwa dang
The powers of invulnerability, pacification, protection,
parol chok lé gyalwé tu drub gyur
And victory over opponents are hereby accomplished!

By the Invincible One (Mipham).
