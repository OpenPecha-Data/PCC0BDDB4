A Sādhana of Kurukullā
by Mipham Rinpoche

tongpé ngang lé pé nyi roden teng
Out of the state of emptiness, upon lotus, sun and corpse,
hrih lé rikjé wangmo kudok mar
A syllable Hrīḥ transforms into Kurukullā, red in colour,
shyal chik chak shyi yitrok shyön dzum tro
With one face, four arms, enchanting youthfulness and wrathful smile,
dangpö chak nyi utpal dashyu geng
Her first two hands draw a bow and arrow of utpala flowers,
tamé chak nyi chakkyu shyakpa nam
And the final two hold a hook and lasso.
chen sum mar dum utra marser dzé
She has three round red eyes and streaming orange hair adorned with five dry skulls,
tökam ngé gyen tö lön doshal chang
And she wears a garland of freshly severed heads,
rüpé gyen dang dar chang tak sham tré
Bone ornaments, silk scarf and a skirt of tiger skin.
kyangkum gartab nyimé gyab yolchen
With one leg stretched and the other bent, she is in dancing pose with a sun behind
ö mar long shyuk sishyi dangchü guk
And in an expanse of red light, summoning the vital essence of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
né sum yigé yeshe chendrang tim
The wisdom deity is invited through the syllables at her three centres, then dissolves.
rik ngé wangkur nang té ur gyenpé
The five families confer empowerment, with Amitābha as the crown ornament.
tuk ü nyi teng hrih la ngak kyi kor
In the centre of her heart, upon a sun disc is a syllable Hrīḥ surrounded by the mantra,
ö trö sishyi püntsok wangdü gyur
From which light radiates out, magnetizing all that is excellent in saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
om kurukullé hrih soha
oṃ kurukulle hrīḥ svāhā

Anyone who merely thinks and recites in this way will gain control of the Three Realms.
