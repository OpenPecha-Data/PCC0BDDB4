The Perfect Equality of the Dharmadhātu

by Mipham Rinpoche

Namo Mañjuśrīye!

A key point to understand in both sūtra and mantra vehiclesIs the perfect equality of the dharmadhātu.And
when realising this perfect equality,Realisation of the view of entities is
crucial.

Through familiarity with the key points ofThe view of the Middle Way beyond conceptsAnd co-emergent
great bliss on the path of mantra,You'll come to understand non-conceptual simplicity,And
self-arising wisdom beyond the mind will dawn.

When your familiarity with this becomes stable,All the phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are
perfectly equal.And the dharmakāya, the single all-encompassing sphere,Dawns unobstructedly
in your being.

All phenomena are perfectly equal.And in perfect equality there's no acceptance or rejection.When
you are confident about perfect equality,Realisation is said to 'reach its limit'.

When reaching the limit of realisation,Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,Pleasure and pain, self and other,Are
all liberated in perfect equality.This is fearlesness, universal victory.

One who has gained such universal victory,Passes through the stages ofVidyādhara, vīra and buddhas'
heir,And comes to train living beings,Their every connection being meaningful.

Thus, having realised the authentic view,Through the instructions of the lineage,And gained
stability with supreme familiarity,One will finally become a victorious vidyādhara.

When this advice has maturedIn the minds of those of excellent fortune,And they see the genuine
path, may theySeize the stronghold of the vidyādhara's realisation.

I, Mipham, quickly wrote this down at Shedzong Tashi Chöling, on the 26th day of the twelfth
month of the Iron Mouse year.[1]
