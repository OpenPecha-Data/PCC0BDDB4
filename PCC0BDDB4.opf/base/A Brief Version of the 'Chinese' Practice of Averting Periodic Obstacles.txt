A Brief Version of the 'Chinese' Practice of Averting Periodic Obstacles1
by Mipham Rinpoche

mawé sengé dak gyü chin gyi lop
Lion of Speech,2 inspire us with your blessings!
si kek ten té ngenpa gyur du sol
We request you: transform si demons, periodic obstacles,3 bad signs and evil omens!
gyalpö chépa pé kyi jikpa sok
And avert all punishment by decree, fear of adversaries,
tsang dru tsö dang gölwa dok tu sol
Exposure of faults, disagreement and dispute, we pray!

↑ There is some disagreement about why this practice is referred to as Chinese. In its fuller
form it makes use of the Chinese astrological system (nag rtsis). It has also been suggested
that the name derives from the fact that the fuller dhāraṇī was originally translated
into Chinese.↑ A form of Mañjuśrī.↑ That is, obstacles associated with a particular period
of time.
