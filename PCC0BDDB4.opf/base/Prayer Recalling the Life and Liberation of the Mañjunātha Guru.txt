These confused verses appended to the prayer of life and liberation composed by the omniscient
master Mipham Rinpoche were added by Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö at the request of the gracious
Khenchen Kunzang Palden, who said that I should supplement the prayer with verses related
to the perfection stage of the six lamps of Mañjuśrī, as well as other perfection stage
practices and the fruition that comes from completing these in experience. I confess any errors
or contradictions. May this virtue become a cause for us to be guided and cared for
by the glorious guru. Maṅglam.

↑ Limited, or more literally nearsighted or myopic, valid cognition (tshur mthong tshad ma)
based on rationality is often contrasted in Mipham’s writings with the valid cognition of
pure visions (dag gzigs tshad ma) that transcends rationality.↑ Candra here is short for Candrakīrti.↑
This is a reference to the Abhisamayālaṃkāra, or Ornament of Clear Realization.↑
That is, the thirteenth bhūmi.
