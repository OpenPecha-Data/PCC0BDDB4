Prayer to Smṛtijñānakīrti
by Mipham Rinpoche

pakyul khé dang drubpé khyuchok ni
Chief among the learned and accomplished of the noble land,
khyen tsé nü pa tsungmé chö kyi jé
Lord of Dharma, unparalleled in wisdom, love and power,
drenpé jinlab dütsi char bebpa
The thought of whom brings a nectar-like rain of blessings—
smiti jnané shyab la solwa deb
Smṛtijñānakīrti, at your feet I pray!

Mipham wrote this for the devoted Wangyal. May virtue abound!
