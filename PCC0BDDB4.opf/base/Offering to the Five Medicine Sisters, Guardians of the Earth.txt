Offering to the Five Medicine Sisters, Guardians of the Earth
by Mipham Rinpoche

hrih, ying kyi yumchen lhenkyé daki nga
Hrīḥ! Five ḍākinīs who arise simultaneously with the great Mother of Space,
shyingkyong mentsün ché ngé tsul tönpé
Manifesting as the five medicine sisters, guardians of the earth,
bumtrak khandrö khor dang chepa nam
Together with your retinue of hundreds of thousands of ḍākinīs:
sol lo chö do cholwé trinlé dzö
We supplicate you! We make this offering to you! Carry out the activities we request of you!
om bendza tramo ha bam harinisa ma ma dakini balingta khahi

Jampal Gyepé Dorje wrote this on the thirteenth day of the first month of the Water Dragon year
(1892) when there was a need for a text to accompany the accumulation of offerings.
