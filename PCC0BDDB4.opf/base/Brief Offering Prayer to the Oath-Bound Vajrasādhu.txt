by Mipham Rinpoche

Hūṃ! Great oath-bound being, Vajrasādhu—Tiklé Tsal,
gyé dé tenma dzin ging ponyé tsok
Along with those who delight you, the tenma goddesses, kiṃkaras and messengers,
kuché sumgya drukchü tsok dangché
And the assembly of three hundred and sixty brothers:
sol lo chö do cholwé trinlé dzö
We supplicate you! We make this offering to you! Carry out the activities we request!
