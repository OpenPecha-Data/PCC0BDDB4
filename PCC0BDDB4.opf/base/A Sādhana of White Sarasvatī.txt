A Sādhana of White Sarasvatī
by Mipham Rinpoche

Meditate on taking refuge, generating bodhicitta and the immeasurables. Then:
tongpé ngang lé pekar dawé teng
Out of the state of emptiness, upon a lotus and moon,
rangnyi dorjé yangchen dawé dang
I myself transform into Sarasvatī glowing like a moon,
shyön gek yitrok tsenpé palbar ma
Ablaze in youthful and graceful splendour with the major and minor marks of perfection, stunning
to behold,
shyal chik chak nyi baidur biwam dreng
With one face and two arms raising a lapis lazuli vīṇā.
dar dang rinchen gyen dzok tsok pur shyuk
I am garbed in all the silken and jewelled adornments, and my two legs are crouching.
tukkar da teng sabön hring karpo
At my heart upon a moon-disc is a seed syllable Hrīṃ, white in colour,
dé lé ö trö sishyi dangchü dang
From which light radiates out, causing the vital essence of conditioned existence and ultimate
peace
zung pob lodrö malü rab dü né
As well as retention, eloquence and wisdom to be gathered in completely, without any exception,
rang gi nyinggé sabön la timpé
And dissolve into the seed syllable at my heart.
jikme ngak gi wangchuk drubpar gyur
Through this, I attain the state of a fearless master of speech.
hring
Hrīṃ
Recite this single syllable as many times as possible. Then, recite the mantra of Vowels and
Consonants and the mantra of ‘The Essence of Interdependent Origination’. Conclude with the
dedication of merit and verses of auspiciousness.

Composed by Mipham.
