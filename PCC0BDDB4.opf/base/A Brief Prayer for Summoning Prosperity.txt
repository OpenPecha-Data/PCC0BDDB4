A Brief Prayer for Summoning Prosperity
by Jamgön Mipham Rinpoche

hung, chok sum tsa sum ngak dang chak gyé tü
Hūṃ! By the power of mantras and mudrās of the Three Jewels and Three Roots,
tenyo sishyi cha yang getsen kün
May all the good omens, abundance and prosperity of the animate and inanimate universe, both
saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
dir khuk dir dü pelgyé mi nubpar
Be summoned and gathered here, and expand without ever declining,
dekyi tashi lektsok palbar shok
So that the splendour of happiness, well-being, auspiciousness and all that is good may blaze
forth!

This was composed by Dhīḥ on the sixth day of the tenth month of the Wood Dragon year (1904).
