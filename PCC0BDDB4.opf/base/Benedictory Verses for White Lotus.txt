Benedictory Verses for White Lotus

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Oṃ svasti.The embodiment of the activity of the victorious ones of past, present and futureWas
the great ācārya of Oḍḍiyāna, whose wisdom mind is invokedThrough the melodious vajra words,The
naturally arisen treasure house of the great secrets.

To deliver up its contents, the jewels of profound meaning,One must have the assurance of realization,
the full power of wisdom intent,As a vidyādhara who understands the scriptural
collections and the meaning of the tantras.For this is not within the purview of arrogant
intellectuals.

This treasure mine of the vajra words' hidden meaningComes from the one who is without rival
and victorious over all,[1]Mipham Jamyang, the foremost heirOf the Lake-born Guru, Dorje
Ziji.[2]

With the pure, unobstructed vision of dharmic sight,And the excellent force of analysis based
on threefold validity[3]He took the key of the White Lotus of excellent explanationFrom
the casket of the invincible fivefold expanse of clear light.

Through the virtue of producing this inexhaustible gift of Dharma,May the environment and inhabitants
be perfected as the maṇḍala of the Illusory Web,And for as long as space itself
remains,May this Dharma never decline but spread everywhere far and wide.

The benefactor Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö contributed this utterance. Sarva siddhirastu. Maṅgalaṃ.
