Acala Sādhana
by Mipham Rinpoche

The preliminaries and conclusion are done in the usual way. The main part is as follows:
tongpé ngang lé pé nyi dü shyi teng
From the state of emptiness, upon a sun and moon and the four māras,
mi yo gönpo tingnak trowö ku
Appears Acala the guardian, dark blue and wrathful in form.
chak yé raldri yönpé shyakpa dzin
His right hand holds a sword and the left a lasso.
durtrö ché dzok shyab yön pü tsuk shyuk
He has all the charnel ground accoutrements and stands with left knee genuflected.
yeshe mepung barwé ü nyi na
In the midst of a blazing mass of wisdom fire
gar gü nyamden tukkar nyimé teng
He conveys the nine moods of dance, and at his heart upon a sun
hung la ngak kyi trengwé korwa lé
Is the syllable Hūṃ surrounded by the rotating mantra garland,
ö trö dön jé jinlab ngödrub dü
From which light radiates out to carry out activity and collect blessings and accomplishment.
om tsenda maha roshana hung pé
oṃ caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa hūṃ phaṭ
Reciting this ten-syllable king of dhāraṇī mantras a single time pacifies all the gods, nāgas
and yakṣas of this world. It brings freedom from all sickness brought on by infectious disease
and the like. A single recitation definitely incinerates all harmful actions such as
the boundless crimes. This exceedingly multifaceted practice is the unsurpassed antidote
to all obstacles, such as māras.

Composed by Mipham. Let it be virtuous!
