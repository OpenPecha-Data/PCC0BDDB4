Essence of the 84000 Approaches to the Dharma

by Mipham Rinpoche

All 84,000 approaches to the DharmaAre included within Atiyoga, the Great Perfection.The crucial
points of the Atiyoga pathBoil down to naturally arising wisdom.The primordially unborn
nature of mindIs unceasing, self-radiant and unfabricated.Wisdom is to recognize one’s
own natureOn the basis of the lama's instructions.The unique sphere, the dharmadhātu,Which
is the nature of all phenomena,Is the unsurpassable wisdom of non-duality,The supreme, most
splendid form of Mañjuśrī.

Mañjuśrīvajra composed this on the ninth day of the fourth month in the year of the Fire Monkey.
Virtue.
