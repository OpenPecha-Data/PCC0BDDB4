A Sādhana of Jambhala
by Mipham Rinpoche

rangnyi kechik palden dzam bha la
In a single instant, I am the glorious Jambhala,
ser dok dar dang rinchen gyen gyi dzé
The colour of gold, beautiful in silk and jewel ornaments.
chak yé shingtok bidza pura ka
My right hand holds a bījapūraka fruit,1
yönpé rinchen ter gyi né'u lé dzin
And my left a mongoose of jewel treasure.
chekyil pema dawé den la shyuk
I am in half-lotus posture on a lotus and moon.
tukkar da teng dzam la ngak kyi kor
At my heart upon a moon-disc is a syllable Dzaṁ surrounded by the mantra.
namo ratna traya ya | namo mani bhadra ya | maha yaksha sé napa ta yé | om dzambha la dzalendra
ya soha
namo ratna trayāya | namo maṇi bhadraya | mahāyakṣa senāpataye | oṃ dzaṁbhala dzalenḍrāye svāhā
Whoever hears this mantra will, in all their lifetimes, be free from poverty and disadvantage,
and accumulate an abundance of fortune. Finally, they will attain the state of buddhahood.
Recite this secret mantra, the excellent seed and other syllables, which bestows the fulfilment
of all supreme wishes, as many times as possible, but mainly recite the ten-syllable
heart mantra.
In between sessions, offer the maṇḍala and so forth, and recite praises and supplications. Conclude
with nonconceptual meditation, the dedication of merit and verses of auspiciousness.

This was written by Mipham.
