Light Offering Prayer
by Mipham Rinpoche

rigpa kadak nangsal marmé di
This brightly shining lamp of primordial pure awareness,
rigdzin kyilkhor pejung lha la bul
We offer to the Lotus-Born and deities of the vidyādhara maṇḍala.
rigpé gar khyab magyur drowa nam
May all beings, our own mothers, as far as awareness pervades,
riktong chökü gopang tobpar shok
Reach the state of the dharmakāya—aware emptiness!
