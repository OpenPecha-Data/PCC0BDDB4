Wrathful Guru Mantra Visualization
by Mipham Rinpoche

The meditation for the mantra repetition is as follows:
rangnyi ké chik dren dzok su
In an instant of perfect recollection,
guru drakpo tingnak ku
I arise as the Wrathful Guru, blue-black in colour,
yepé dorjé yön tötrak
I brandish a vajra in my right hand and hold a skull-cup filled with blood in my left.
chib su pak gö kham nak chib
I stand on the back of a dark brown wild boar,
shyal né drakngak metak tro
From whose mouth the fiery sparks of wrathful mantras blaze forth.
rang trul pak gö pakmé trö
I emanate inconceivable numbers of wild boar
nedön hurtum zöpar sam
Who devour all illness and spirit harm.
drakngak mé ö gar gyi ni
The blazing fire of their roaring wrathful mantras shoots like sparks,
tsatsa tar trö nedön sek
Incinerating all illness and demons.
Maintain the visualization without distraction and repeat the mantra.
The mantra is as follows:
om bhehu nakhe | tsana duhehu | bhishama hira hong | trinadukhe | bheshena ta | bhinaya soha
