Sukhāvatī Aspiration
by Jamgön Mipham Rinpoche

For those who wish to be reborn in the blissful pure land, there is a practice that incorporates
the four causes of rebirth in Sukhāvatī. For this, you should focus one-pointedly on
the form of Buddha Amitābha, recite his name at least seven times each day, and perform the
following:
drenpa öpak mépa gong su sol
Guide of Limitless Light—Amitābha—turn your enlightened attention towards me!
gyalwa khyé kyi tukkyé ji shyin du
Just as you, a victorious one, generated the mind of bodhicitta,
lamé chang chub chok tu sem kyé dé
I too now set my mind on unsurpassable, supreme awakening,
gewé tsawa ji nyé gyipa nam
And whatever sources of virtue I have created, I dedicate
nub chok dewachen gyi shying kham su
So that I may be reborn in your presence, supreme victorious one,
gyal chok khyé kyi drung du kyé né kyang
Within the western pure land of Sukhāvatī,
lapchen gyalwé sé kyi chöpa kun
There to perfect entirely all the beneficial activity
yong su dzokpé lé du ngo gyi na
Of an heir to the victorious ones.
tsé di pö ma tak tu dakpé shying
As soon as I depart from this life,
dewachen du dzü té kyewa dang
May I miraculously take birth in that pure realm of Sukhāvatī,
drenpa öpakmé kyi lung ten né
And having received a prophecy from the Guide of Limitless Light,
dzok min jangwa ta ru chinpar shok
May I bring perfecting, maturing and purifying to completion!

sangyé opakmé la solwa dep
Amitābha, Buddha of Limitless Light, to you I pray!
dak gi lamé chang chub sem kyé né
Having set my mind on the attainment of supreme awakening,
gé tsa tadak dechen shying chok tu
As I dedicate all my sources of virtue towards rebirth in that supreme land of great bliss,
kyé chir ngo na drubpar ching gyi lop
Grant your blessings so that this aspiration may be fulfilled!

By the one named Dhīḥ.
