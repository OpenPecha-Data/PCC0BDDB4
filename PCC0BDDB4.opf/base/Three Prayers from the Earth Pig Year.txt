Three Prayers from the Earth Pig Year
by Jamgön Mipham Rinpoche

chomden shyitro rabjam gong su sol
Infinite blessed deities, peaceful and wrathful, turn your attention towards me, I pray!
yeshe tukjé chenpö drelpé na
Since we are connected through your great wisdom and compassion,
dak sok damtsik nyamchak tamché kün
May all the impairments and breakages of samaya that I and others have committed
tukdam chenpö wang gi dakpar dzö
Be purified through the power of your great sacred pledge.
And:
ho, jampal shyönnu rangjung yeshe ku
Ho! Youthful Mañjuśrī, the body of self-arisen original wisdom,
nying la yermé shyukpé özer gyi
Dwelling inseparably within my heart—through radiating rays of light,
trulnang khorwé münpa malüpa
Cause all the darkness of deluded perception within saṃsāra
nyamnyi dechen ying su dakpar dzö
To be cleared away in the basic space of equality and great bliss.
And:
ho, gyü sum rigdzin lama tukjé chen
Ho!  Vidyādhara gurus of the three lineages with your compassion,
yidam shyitro rabjam jinlab chen
Infinite peaceful and wrathful yidam deities with your blessings,
né sum pawo khandro tutsal chen
Ḍākas and ḍākinīs of the three places with your power and strength,
damchen chökyong sungma tukdam chen
Protectors, dharmapālas and guardian deities with your scared pledges,
malü tamché dak la gong su sol
All of you, please turn your attention towards me, I pray!
nyamtak dungwé yi kyi solwa deb
With a mind that is tormented by weariness and sorrow, I beg you:
tukdam ma yel tukjé nyurdu zik
Do not forget your sacred pledge, but gaze upon me at once with your compassion,
jingyi lob shik choktün ngödrub tsol
Grant me your blessings, and bestow the supreme and ordinary accomplishments!

These three prayers were written by Dhīḥ in the year of the Earth Pig. Virtue!
