mitün barché gek kün yongsu shyi
May all disharmony, obstacles and hindrances be thoroughly pacified;
dögu püntsok paljor pel shying gyé
May our wealth and prosperity and supplies of all that we desire expand and multiply;
gang sam yishyin lhündrub wang gi chuk
May we gain the power of spontaneously accomplishing whatever we wish;
dragek tsarchö chok lé namgyal shok
And may we overcome foes and obstructers and reign victorious over all!

Composed on the sixth day of the first month of the Iron Rabbit year (1891).
