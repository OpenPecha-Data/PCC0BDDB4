Advice for Beginners

by Mipham Rinpoche

Kyeho! All activities within saṃsāra are pointless and hollow—Unreliable and fleeting, like
lightning's streaking dance,And there is no certainty as to when death will strike.Still,
since death is certain, limit idle plans and speculations,Allow the teacher's instructions
to hit home and strike a chord,And, single-pointedly, in solitude, seek perfect certainty
of mind.Mind, which is like lightning, a breeze, or passing clouds,Is coloured by its various
thoughts of everything under the sun,But when examined thoroughly is found to lack a
basis or origin.Just like a mirage on the horizon, it is devoid of essential nature.While
being empty, it appears; and while appearing, it is empty.Left to settle, naturally, by itself,
mind arrives at a genuine state of ease,And, when familiarity grows stable, mind's natural
condition is seen.If devotion to the teacher grows vast, blessings will enter and inspire
the mind,And when accumulations are gathered and obscurations purified, realization
will dawn—So take this practice to heart, carefully and with constant effort!

When some beginners asked me for advice on practice, I, the one called Mipham, wrote this for
their instruction. May virtue abound!
