A Shower of Wisdom: A Guru Yoga of Garab Dorje
by Mipham Rinpoche

ah, dak gi chitsuk pé dé den teng su
Āḥ! At the crown of my head, upon a lotus and moon-disc,
palden dorjé sempa trulpé ku
Is the nirmāṇakāya emanation of glorious Vajrasattva,
garab dorjé karsal tulkü ché
Garab Dorje, brilliant white and with nirmāṇakāya ornaments,
tsenpé palbar chö ché chakgya chen
Ablaze in splendour with the major and minor marks and hands in the Dharma-teaching mudrā.
rabjam kyab kün düpé ngowor mik
I visualize him as the essential embodiment of infinite sources of refuge,
nying né dungshuk drakpö soltab pé
Supplicate with intense devotion from the core of my heart,
tukgyü gongpé jinlab pöpar sam
And consider that the blessings of realization are transferred from his wisdom mind.
yangzab lamé nyingpo taktu drang
Continuously, I recite this, the most profound essence of the Guru:
om ah maha guru trahé benza dzana siddhi hung
oṃ āḥ mahā guru prahevajra jñāna siddhi hūṃ
jinlab yeshe ngödrub nyurdu tob
Through this I swiftly gain blessings, wisdom and attainments.

Written by Jampal Dorje. Maṅgalaṃ! On the sixteenth day of the tenth month of the Fire Bird
year. May it be virtuous!
