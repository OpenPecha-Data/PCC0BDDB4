A Method of Purifying Samaya Violations by Relying on the Glorious Guru Vajrasattva
by Mipham Rinpoche

dak gi nying ü pema dawé teng
Upon a lotus and moon disc at the center of my heart
tsawé lama palden dorjé sem
Is the glorious Vajrasattva, my root Guru,
karsal dorjé dril dzin longkü ché
Pure white in color, holding vajra and bell and with the dress of a saṃbhogakāya,
dechen nyemma yum dang nyampar jor
In union with the consort, Vajragarvā of great bliss.1
ku lé özer dütsi karpö gyün
From their bodies, a white stream of amṛta and rays of light flow down filling my entire body.
babpé lü gang nedön dikdrib dang
Through this, all sicknesses, evil influences, misdeeds, obscurations
damtsik nyamchak tamché dak gyur né
And violations of samaya are completely purified.
dechen nyamnyi dorjé ku tob gyur
And I obtain the vajra body of great bliss and equanimity.
om benza sato hung
Oṃ vajrasattva hūṃ
Recite the mantra as many times as you can. Then, conclude with the dedication of merit and
verses of auspiciousness.
Mipham wrote on the ninth day of the third month of Earth Monkey year (1908). May there be supreme
excellence!

↑ Although Vajrāṭopā is sometimes given as the Sanskrit name of Vajrasattva's consort, whose
Tibetan name is Dorje Nyemma (rdo rje snyems ma), it seems that the correct Sanskrit name,
which is attested in extant sources, is Vajragarvā
