Benedictory Verses for A Brilliant Elucidation of Logical Reasoning

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Oṃ svasti.When evaluating with the determinative science of valid cognitionThe words of the
victorious ones and treatises that comment on their intention,It is this alone that establishes
how the Teacher and his teachings are authentic,This alone that brings unfailing certainty.


Dignāga, who was guided by Mañjughoṣa,Was roused by the drums of this Treasury of Wisdom's speech.The
resulting work, a most excellent compendium,Provides scholars with immaculate, clear
vision.

As for the commentarial annotations upon this textBy Mañjughoṣa in person, Mipham Namgyal Gyatso,It
was the great sublime tulku of Palyul, Karma Gyurme,Who produced this edition out
of a pure motivation.

Through the virtue of this, may all sentient beingsSet out upon the path that is authentic,And
attain without the slightest difficultyThe supreme level of omniscience—all-knowing and
all-seeing.

These aspirational verses for the colophon were written by Lodrö Gyatso, who holds the name
of a Khyentse incarnation, in response to a request from Lama Shingkyong. Śubhaṃ.
