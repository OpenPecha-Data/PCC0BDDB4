by Mipham Rinpoche

hrih, neyul durtrö kün gyi dakmo ni
Hrīḥ! Lady, owner of all charnel grounds and sacred places –
shyingkyong khandrö wangchuk ngennema
Ngenema, you are the lokapāla who holds dominion over all ḍākinīs.
dzutrul tuden khor dang chepa nam
To you, along with your entourage of powerful magicians,
sol lo chö do cholwé trinlé dzö
I offer this feast and entreat your enlightened action.
