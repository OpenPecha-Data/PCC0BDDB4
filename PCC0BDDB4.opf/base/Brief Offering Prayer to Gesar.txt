Brief Offering Prayer to Gesar
by Mipham Rinpoche

kyé, dödön kün drub dralha tuwo ché
Kyé! Mighty warrior deity who fulfils all wishes
rik sum pemé gyutrul sengchen gyal
Great Lion King, magical emanation of Padma and the three families,1
norbu dradul kadö ponyar ché
Norbu Dradul Tsal, together with your attendants and emissaries,
sollo chödo samdön kün drub dzö
We invoke you, we offer to you—cause all our wishes to be fulfilled!

In accordance with the request of the diligent practitioner and lord of yogis, Vidyādhara, this
was written by Jampal Dorje in the retreat house of Dülé Namgyal Ling (The Place of Total
Victory over the Māras) on the seventh day of the twelfth month. Through this, may the
precious teachings of the practice lineage reign victorious over all!
